# FuNgiht
The management of night-time events faces some challenges these days, such as the
difficulty in finding centralized information and the ticket purchasing processes. The
FuNight project is a solution in the form of a mobile application that brings together all the
night-time events and makes it easier to buy tickets for them, with a focus on improving
the user experience. This app uses a distributed architecture with a mobile application
developed in Flutter, a backend in FastAPI with Python, and databases in MySQL (for
events) as well as Firebase Firestore (for users and tickets). The payment functionality is
illustrative, with the possibility of obtaining directions to the venue from the user's own
location.
